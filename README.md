# Algorithms and Data Structure Implementation

Welcome to the **Algorithms and Data Structures Implementation** repository. This project is focused on practicing and improving skills in implementing various algorithms and data structures in a structured and systematic way. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, learning new techniques, or just looking to brush up on your skills, this repository provides a hands-on learning experience.

## ðŸ“œ Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to:

- Recap important Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.
- Improve problem-solving skills by implementing them from scratch.
- Provide clear, efficient, and well-documented implementations of common algorithms and data structures.
- Share knowledge and create a helpful reference for learners and developers.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on the type of data structure or algorithm. Each folder contains code implementations and possibly a README to explain the specific structure or algorithm.

### Example Structure

- **DataStructures**: Contains various data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Contains algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.
- **Problems**: Example coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, showcasing how these data structures and algorithms are applied in problem-solving.
